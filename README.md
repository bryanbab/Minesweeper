# MineSweeper Game ðŸ’£

This is a classic implementation of the **MineSweeper** game built using Java. The game features a grid of cells, each of which can either contain a mine or be empty. The goal is to uncover all the non-mine cells without triggering any mines. Players can flag ðŸš© cells they suspect contain mines and reveal adjacent cells when a mine-free cell is uncovered.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**: A grid of cells where each cell can either be revealed or flagged.
- **Mines**: Randomly placed mines that the player must avoid.
- **Flagging**: Right-click to place or remove flags on cells.
- **Flood Fill**: Reveals neighboring cells when a cell with no adjacent mines is clicked.
- **Timer**: Tracks the time spent on the game.

- **Game Over**: The game ends when a mine is clicked or the game is won
